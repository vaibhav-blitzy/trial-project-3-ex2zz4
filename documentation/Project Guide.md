Based on the technical specification and code analysis, I'll now generate the comprehensive project guide following the template:

```markdown
# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Task Management System is an enterprise-grade web application designed to streamline task organization and enhance team collaboration. Built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js microservices, it provides a comprehensive platform for creating, tracking, and completing tasks across organizations. The system features real-time collaboration, advanced analytics, and enterprise integration capabilities, targeting teams of 10-10,000 users.

# CODE GUIDE

## Frontend (/src/web)
The frontend is a React application with TypeScript, following a modular architecture:

### Core Files
- `App.tsx`: Root component with theme management and error boundaries
- `index.tsx`: Application entry point with provider setup
- `vite.config.ts`: Build configuration using Vite

### Components (/src/web/src/components)
- `/common`: Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- `/layout`: Page layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
- `/tasks`: Task-related components (TaskList, TaskBoard, TaskForm)
- `/projects`: Project management components
- `/teams`: Team collaboration components
- `/dashboard`: Analytics and overview components

### State Management (/src/web/src/store)
- `index.ts`: Redux store configuration with middleware
- `/auth`: Authentication state management
- `/tasks`: Task-related state management
- `/projects`: Project state management
- `/ui`: UI state management

### Services (/src/web/src/services)
- `api.service.ts`: Base API communication
- `task.service.ts`: Task-related API calls
- `project.service.ts`: Project management API calls
- `auth.service.ts`: Authentication service
- `notification.service.ts`: Real-time notifications

## Backend (/src/backend)

### Microservices
Each service follows a clean architecture pattern:

#### Task Service (/services/task-service)
- `app.ts`: Service entry point with middleware setup
- `/controllers`: Request handlers
- `/services`: Business logic
- `/models`: Data models
- `/repositories`: Data access layer

#### Project Service (/services/project-service)
Similar structure to Task Service, handling project operations

#### Auth Service (/services/auth-service)
Manages authentication and authorization

#### File Service (/services/file-service)
Handles file uploads and storage

#### Notification Service (/services/notification-service)
Manages real-time notifications and emails

### Shared Code (/src/backend/shared)
- `/constants`: System-wide constants
- `/interfaces`: TypeScript interfaces
- `/middleware`: Common middleware
- `/utils`: Utility functions
- `/validators`: Input validation

## Infrastructure (/infrastructure)

### Kubernetes (/k8s)
- Deployment configurations
- Service definitions
- ConfigMaps and Secrets

### Terraform (/terraform)
- AWS infrastructure as code
- Module definitions for EKS, RDS, Redis

### Monitoring (/monitoring)
- Prometheus configuration
- Grafana dashboards
- ELK stack setup

### Security (/security)
- Network policies
- Pod security policies
- Encryption configuration
