Our project aims to deliver a robust, secure, and scalable task management platform. By contributing, you agree to follow our standards for code quality, security, and documentation.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of background or experience level. All participants in our project are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

### Standards

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

### Enforcement

Violations of the code of conduct may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x LTS)
- Docker (v20.x)
- Git (v2.x)
- VS Code (recommended)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-system.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Security tests
npm run test:security

# All tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Style Guidelines

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Prettier** (v2.x): For code formatting
- **ESLint** (v8.x): For code linting
- Configuration files: `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc.json`

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Format: `<type>/<description>`

Types:
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes
- `release/` - Release preparations
- `security/` - Security-related changes

Example: `feature/add-task-filtering`

### Commit Messages
